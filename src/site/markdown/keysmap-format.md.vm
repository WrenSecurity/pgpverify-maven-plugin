KeysMap file format
====================

The format of the file is similar to, but more flexible than, a Java properties file.
The syntax of each line of properties file is:

    groupId:artifactId:packaging:version=pgpKeyFingerprint
    
Where

- `groupId`           - groupId of maven artifact, this filed is required, but can be `*` for mach any   
- `artifactId`        - artifactId of maven artifact
- `packaging`         - packaging of maven artifact, eg. `pom`, `jar` 
- `version`           - version of maven artifact, this filed support maven version range syntax
- `pgpKeyFingerprint` - pgp key fingerprints in hex format which are allowed to sign artifact,
                 can be supplied many keys separated by comma  

PGP keys special values
----------------------

`pgpKey` field can contains many pgp fingerprints, separated by comma,
each fingerprint must start with `0x`. There are allowed whitespace in hex fingerprint.

`pgpKey` can also contains special values:

- `*`, `any` - match any key for artifact
- `noSig`    - allow artifact without signature
- `badSig`   - allow artifact with invalid signature
- `noKey`    - allow that key for artifact will not exist on public key servers

The order of items and matching
-------------------------------

The order of items is not important, all matching items are checked for keys or special values.
Process is continued until first matching item is found or end of items is reached.

Comments 
--------

Everything from `#` (hash sign) and continue to the end of the line are comment and will be skipped.    

Multiline
---------

If line is ending with ` \ ` (backslash) break of line will be removed and next line will be joined.

There are allowed whitespace and comments after ` \ `.

Examples
--------

match any artifact from group with any packaging and version 

    test.groupId = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
---

match any artifact from group and any subgroups with any packaging and version 

    test.groupId.* = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890  
---

match a specific artifact with any packaging and version

    test.groupId:artifactId = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890  
---

match a specific artifact with packaging and with any version

    test.groupId:artifactId:jar = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
---

match a specific artifact with packaging and version

    test.groupId:artifactId:jar:1.0.0 = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
---

match a specific artifact with packaging and version range

    test.groupId:artifactId:jar:[1.0.0,2.0.0) = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
---

match a specific artifact with the version and any packaging

    test.groupId:artifactId:1.0.0 = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890  
---

match a specific artifact with any version and packaging and many keys
   
    test.groupId:artifactId = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890, 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890, \ 
                              0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
---

allow bad signature for a specific artifact with version

    test.groupId:artifactId           = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
    test.groupId:artifactId:pom:1.0.0 = badSig
---

match specific artifact with any packaging and version and allow that signature will not exist

    test.groupId:artifactId = 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890, noSig
